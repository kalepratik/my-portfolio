    "intro": "AI‑led data and analytics strategy that enables teams to move faster — with practical guardrails, measurable outcomes, and sleeves‑rolled‑up execution.",
    "story": "I work with teams to design and ship end‑to‑end data and analytics solutions: ingestion, modeling, semantic layers, and selective LLM/RAG. I translate business goals into platform choices and operating standards — and I contribute directly where impact is highest (reference implementations, reviews, and performance fixes).",
    "approach": "Balanced leadership: clarify outcomes and KPIs; co‑create lightweight standards (data contracts, metrics/semantic layer, cost/perf guardrails); build reference patterns; pair‑program and review; coach analysts and engineers; document the essentials; hand over maintainable systems. Cloud: OCI, AWS, Azure.",
